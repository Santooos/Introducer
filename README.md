# IOS102 Pre-Work: Introduce Yourself
# Welcome to the prework for iOS Intermediate Development! Together we will build a functional app that shows us the basics of navigating Xcode and Swift. This app will allow us to introduce ourselves by accepting user inputs in various forms, such as switches, text fields, segmented controls, and more. By the end of this prework, you will see how the storyboard and logic combine to make one functional app.
